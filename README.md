Dice roller project

13/04/2022
My first project. I have spent way too long and been too fussy over little details when I wanted to practice layout and learn about buttons and input. So far I have learned grid, js animations, hilarious function mayhem, onclick and I struggled hard with the rotate animation as a function. It would only turn once and then stop. Next I want to tackle making my functions more universal instead of copy pasting them for each button. The center needs finishing and I need to learn setTimeout.
