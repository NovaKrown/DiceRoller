Dice roller project

My first project. I have spent way too long and been too fussy over little details when I wanted to practice layout and learn about buttons and input. So far I have learned grid, js animations, hilarious function mayhem, onclick and I struggled hard with the rotate animation as a function. It would only turn once and then stop. Next I want to tackle making my functions more universal instead of copy pasting them for each button. The center needs finishing and I need to learn setTimeout.

A full day of changes. I updated the javascript so it wasn't repetitive. It was a nightmare to style css with variables. I believe i found a good example and it works. I struggled to add references to elements globally. It worked to place them at the bottom of the HTML page. I repositioned the "crystal ball", it looks awful and cheesy and I dont' believe it is the look I want. Next I want to design pull out menus for skills and a way to fold the log away out of sight.
